            <h1>What is ClowdFlows?</h1>
             <p>ClowdFlows is an <strong>open sourced</strong> cloud based platform for <strong>composition, execution, and sharing</strong> of interactive machine learning and data mining workflows. It is based on the principles of service-oriented knowledge discovery and features interactive scientific workflows. In contrast to comparable data mining platforms, ClowdFlows runs in all major Web browsers and platforms. ClowdFlows provides researchers with an easy way to expose and share their work and results, as only an Internet connection and a Web browser are required to access the workflow from anywhere. Practictioners can use ClowdFlows to seamlessly integrate and join different implementations of algorithms, tools and Web services into a coherent workflow that can be executed in a cloud based application. ClowdFlows is also easily extensible during run-time by importing Web services and using them as new workflow components.</p>
